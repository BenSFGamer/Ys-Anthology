For brevity, this serves as a central hub for all Ys titles. 

The origninal plan was to have the game files (all 17 and counting) downloaded and have them uploaded repository. This is the tedious, hard way (or plain time-consuming). I find more beneficial and effecient to tap into or leverage the various cloud services that may host the games.
